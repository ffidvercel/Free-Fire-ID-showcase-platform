## ✅ I’ve locked these **two features** as MUST-HAVE (we’ll do them later)

I will **not forget** these:

### 🔐 1) Admin-only logic (`/admin`)

* Add new IDs
* Mark IDs as sold
* Hide listings
* Users = read-only
  👉 This **will be implemented** (Firebase-first, clean, no overkill)

### 🚀 2) Antigravity readiness checklist

* Fully clickable cards
* Proper Details page
* Firebase-driven data (no hardcoding)
* Images/videos externalized

👉 We’ll move to Antigravity **only after** these are done.

We are aligned here. No debate, no change.
